Semarang's Melody

Beneath the arch of ancient spires,
Where Kraton whispers through the years,
The city hums with vibrant life,
In every street, a tale appears.

Canals reflect the sky's embrace,
A dance of shadows, old and new;
The scent of sambal fills the air,
As markets bloom in bustling hue.

Oh Semarang, your spirit flows,
Like rivers winding to the sea;
In every heart, your story grows—
A legacy of land and lesehan.
