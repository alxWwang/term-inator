Here’s a quick rundown of the latest key points about the NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Generation (the high‑end workstation GPU launched in early 2023):

| Topic | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Launch & Availability** | • Announced Feb 2023 via NVIDIA’s newsroom. 
• First units shipped to designers, engineers, and HPC customers by late March 2023.
| **Architecture** | • Built on the AD102 GPU (Ada Lovelace). 
• 18,176 CUDA cores, 144 SMs (all but two active).
• 4th‑gen Tensor Cores & 3rd‑gen RT Cores for AI and ray tracing.
| **Memory** | • 48 GB GDDR6 ECC memory – the largest on a single GPU as of its release. 
• 384‑bit memory bus, ~1 TB/s bandwidth.
| **Power & Cooling** | • 300 W TGP (Thermal Design Power). 
• Requires high‑capacity PSU and robust chassis cooling (recommended 500–650 W PSUs).
| **Performance Highlights** | • Targets real‑time rendering, simulation, AI inference & training. 
• Benchmarks: let’s say ~2× faster ray tracing than RTX 8000 in some CAD workloads.
• AI performance up to 10–15× over previous generation for FP16/INT8 tasks.
| **Use Cases** | • Architecture, engineering & construction (AEC). 
• Product design & simulation (CAE). 
• Scientific computing & HPC workloads. 
• Machine‑learning inference for large models.
| **Software Support** | • NVIDIA RTX Enterprise drivers (v387+). 
• CUDA 12+, OptiX, DLSS, TensorRT, and NVIDIA Studio Suite.
| **Competitive Landscape** | • Competes with AMD’s Radeon Pro W6800/Xe 4‑Pro & Intel Xe‑HPG GPUs in the professional space. 
• Offers superior ray‑tracing and AI throughput for its power class.
